# Founders of Teotihuacan Parametric Insert

This is an insert for the game [Founders of Teotihuacan](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/345088/founders-teotihuacan)

It uses the amazing [The Boardgame Insert Toolkit](https://github.com/dppdppd/The-Boardgame-Insert-Toolkit)

It has the library as a sub module, so make sure to clone it with submodules like `git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:fzerorubigd/fot-insert.git`, or clone it first and use `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch the toolkit.

To build the STL files, you need to install the [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/), and if you have make command ready to be used, then by `make all` all the parts plus a solid and a meshed lid will be generated. 

You need one resource box, but in order to fill the box, you can create the second, or use the optional spacer. I use the punch board remaining to level up the insert, but you can either keep it as is, or add something under the insert to elevate it a little.
